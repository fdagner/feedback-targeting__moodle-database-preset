## Description

The feedback from up to four questions can be displayed on a target.

## Getting started

Download the release file. Create a "Database" activity in Moodle and then upload the ZIP file in the "Presets" tab under "Import".

## Language Support

The preset is available in German, but there is not so much to translate. The template can easily be adapted.
